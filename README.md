A Hi-Lo game created for a grade 11 project. Prompted with ranges (i.e. 1-6 and 7-13), with low and high values, respectively. The user is to bet a certain number of points, of their choice, toward their guess (High or low?). 

The user may continue playing indefinitely, as they wish, so long as they do not get zero or a negative integer of points.
